This chapter concludes the thesis with a summary of the main findings and outlines directions for future work.

\section{Conclusions}
This thesis presented an end-to-end pipeline for RGB-only, multi-view detection, classification, and tracking of flying objects (drones vs. birds) targeting robust operation under imperfect calibration, rolling shutter, and partial occlusions. The key contributions are:
\begin{itemize}
  \item 1
  \item 2
\end{itemize}

The experimental evaluation validated the three hypotheses:
\begin{itemize}
  \item 1
  \item 2
\end{itemize}

Ablation studies demonstrated the value of each component: spatiotemporal bundle adjustment, token selection and serialization, DINO distillation, the robustness branch, and synthetic-to-real transfer strategies. The system achieves competitive accuracy on real-world data while maintaining near-real-time throughput (\(\sim\)10--20 fps on a single GPU).

\section{Future Work}
Several promising directions for future work include:

\begin{itemize}
  \item 1
  \item 2
\end{itemize}
