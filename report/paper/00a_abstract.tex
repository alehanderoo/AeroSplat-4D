% We study real-time detection, classification, and tracking of flying objects (e.g., drones vs. birds) using only overlapping RGB cameras. 
% The system outputs probabilistic 3D occupancy with semantics and uncertainty, per-object class labels, and ID-consistent tracks. 
% We propose an end-to-end pipeline that 
% (i) bootstraps and refines camera poses from both static scene and moving-object constraints under rolling shutter and time offsets, 
% (ii) segments dynamics and reconstructs \emph{hybrid 3D--4D Gaussian Splatting (3D-4DGS)}, 
% (iii) classifies directly from (X,Y,Z,T) Gaussians via a two-stream \emph{Rotor-Splat} model combining SE(3)-equivariant geometry with spectral motion features.
% % (iv) performs uncertainty-aware 3D occupancy tracking with robust re-identification. We detail tokenization from Gaussians, DINOv3-guided appearance lifting, Mamba-based temporal modeling, and a robustness branch leveraging depth-rendered 2D views. 
% % An evaluation plan based on occupancy metrics, IDF1/HOTA, RPM MAE, spectral accuracy, and comprehensive ablations is provided.
